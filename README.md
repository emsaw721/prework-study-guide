# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description 
This is a study guide built during the prework section of coding bootcamp! I built this project to understand the basics of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript and to see the basics in action. This not only provides a foundation for lessons during bootcamp, but also taught me the basics needed during every day working.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
